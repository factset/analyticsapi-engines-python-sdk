# **cancel_axioma_optimization_by_id**
> cancel_axioma_optimization_by_id(id)

Cancel Axioma optimization by id

This is the endpoint to cancel a previously submitted optimization. Instead of doing a GET on the polling URL, cancel the request by doing a DELETE.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import fds.analyticsapi.engines
from fds.analyticsapi.engines.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.factset.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = fds.analyticsapi.engines.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.factset.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic
configuration = fds.analyticsapi.engines.Configuration(
    username = 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.analyticsapi.engines.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = fds.analyticsapi.engines.OptimizationsApi(api_client)
    id = 'id_example' # str | from url, provided from the location header in the Run Optimization endpoint

    try:
        # Cancel Axioma optimization by id
        api_instance.cancel_axioma_optimization_by_id(id)
    except ApiException as e:

# **get_axioma_optimization_by_id**
> get_axioma_optimization_by_id(id)

Get Axioma optimization by id

This is the endpoint to check on the progress of a previously requested optimization.  If the optimization has finished computing, the body of the response will contain result in JSON.  Otherwise, the optimization is still running and the X-FactSet-Api-PickUp-Progress header will contain a progress percentage.

Run Axioma optimization

This endpoint runs Axioma optimization specified in the POST body parameters.  It must be used first before polling or cancelling endpoints.  A successful response will contain the URL to poll for the result of the optimization.    Remarks:    * Any settings in POST body will act as a one-time override over the settings saved in the strategy document.
