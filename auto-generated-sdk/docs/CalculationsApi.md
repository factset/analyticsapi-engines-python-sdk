Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**cancel_calculation_by_id**](CalculationsApi.md#cancel_calculation_by_id) | **DELETE** /analytics/engines/v2/calculations/{id} | Cancel calculation by id
[**get_calculation_status_by_id**](CalculationsApi.md#get_calculation_status_by_id) | **GET** /analytics/engines/v2/calculations/{id} | Get calculation status by id
[**get_calculation_status_summaries**](CalculationsApi.md#get_calculation_status_summaries) | **GET** /analytics/engines/v2/calculations | Get all calculation statuses

# **cancel_calculation_by_id**
> cancel_calculation_by_id(id)

Cancel calculation by id

This is the endpoint to cancel a previously submitted calculation request.  Instead of doing a GET on the getCalculationById URL, cancel the calculation by doing a DELETE.  All individual calculation units within the calculation will be canceled if they have not already finished.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import fds.analyticsapi.engines
from fds.analyticsapi.engines.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.factset.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = fds.analyticsapi.engines.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.factset.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic
configuration = fds.analyticsapi.engines.Configuration(
    username = 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fds.analyticsapi.engines.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = fds.analyticsapi.engines.CalculationsApi(api_client)
    id = 'id_example' # str | From url, provided from the location header in the Run Multiple Calculations endpoint.

    try:
        # Cancel calculation by id
        api_instance.cancel_calculation_by_id(id)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling CalculationsApi->cancel_calculation_by_id: %s\n" % e)
```

# **run_calculation**
> run_calculation(calculation=calculation)

Run calculation

This endpoint creates a new calculation and runs the set of calculation units specified in the POST body.  This must be used first before get status or cancelling endpoints with a calculation id.   A successful response will contain the URL to check the status of the calculation request.    Remarks:  * Maximum 500 units allowed across all simultaneous calculations. (Refer API documentation for more information)                * Any settings in POST body will act as a one-time override over the settings saved in the PA/SPAR/Vault template.
